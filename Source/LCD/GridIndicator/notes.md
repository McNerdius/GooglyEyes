# toggle wifi on/of per-pull to save battery

# pull Idle from GooglyFunctions
#    0: turn off LEDs, set poll time to 5 minutes & wait for print to finish
#   -1: poll every min, wait for next print to start or power-off
#   > some value: turn on LEDs, poll every min, wait for next print to start or power-off

# if battery life allows see clock_idea.png

# 5 minute polling will keep the Functions app awake

# just keep on polling...
